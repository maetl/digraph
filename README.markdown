Ruby class for [calculating the strongly connected components](http://maetl.coretxt.net.nz/scc-in-ruby)
of a directed graph.

Operates on graphs constructed with the Set data structure. Finds the strongly connected components of a digraph using the [improved algorithm](http://www.mcs.vuw.ac.nz/~djp/files/P05.pdf) described by David Pearce.

Old and experimental code that I wrote as a comp-sci student. Archived here for posterity.
